# IPLMapGen2-Gamblitz, forked from **maps.iplabs.ink**

## What is this fork?
This is a web based tool (forked from maps.iplabs.ink ) to create map lists for competitive Splatoon 2 events using Project Gamblitz mod. It was created with a focus on making it as easy as possible to create, edit, and share map lists.

## How to use
Visit https://yoshicrystal9.github.io/IPLMapGen2-Gamblitz/ to use the tool. It should function on all modern browsers ignoring minor visual inconsistencies. First, go to Preferences, and change the game to Splatoon 2. Then, you must create a pool of maps that can appear for each mode, then add your round info, and finally choose a generate option. Once a map list is generated, you can edit it by clicking on the map or mode. The app will only let you pick maps within the mode's pool. When you're finished, you can export it as a shareable URL, a discord message, or a JSON file the IPL livestream software can import.
